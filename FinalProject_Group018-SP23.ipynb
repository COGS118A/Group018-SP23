    "# Abstract \n",
    "Our goal for this project is to develop a deep learning / computer vision model to identify breast cancer based on pathology images from the PatchCamelyon (PCam) dataset, using binary classification. The PatchCamelyon dataset consists of 327,680 color images of lymph node samples, each with a size of 96x96 pixels. The images are labeled with one of two classes either indicating the presence or absence of metastatic tissue (which indicates cancerous tissue). We will first pre-process the data by binarizing the pixels to reduce noise. Then, we will be training the last layer of a convolutional neural network on this data. The neural network will be trained to classify the images to a binary label (the detection of cancerous tissue). Success will be measured using sensitivity and specificity. Our main goal is to reduce the false negative rate (by maximizing sensitivity), since false negatives are far more fatal than false positives in this scenario."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The article Artificial intelligence and computational pathology [Nature], published in 2021 by researchers Miao Cui and David Y. Zhang, discusses the immense potential that artificial intelligence has in the field of clinical pathology. Computational pathology uses technology to improve patient care in pathology and lab medicine. It combines different types of medical data, like images and patient information, to make better diagnoses and treatment plans. However, there are many challenges to overcome, like integrating the data and making sure the technology is used ethically. By utilizing modern computational methods, such as genomics, bioinformatics, and machine learning, and applying them to pathology, computational pathology has the potential to “create personalized diagnosis and treatment plans for patients,” “improve clinical workflow efficiency, diagnostic quality,” and offer a “better-integrated solution to whole-slide images, multi-omics data, and clinical informatics.” Most importantly, computational pathology can “reduce errors in diagnosis and classification.” The article states that machine learning algorithms evaluated by CAMELYON16, which evaluates how well algorithms can detect cancer, “[have] achieved encouraging results with a 92.4% sensitivity in tumor detection rate. In contrast, a pathology could only achieve 73.2% sensitivity.” Artificial intelligence is useful for the task of detecting cancer in pathology slide images because it can be trained to find patterns in data and is able to autonomously learn to solve novel problems. Currently, machine learning methods are being used to assist pathologic diagnosis by looking at cancer cells, cell nuclei, cell divisions, ducts, blood vessels, and more. Deep learning and artificial neural networks (ANNs) resemble human cognition, being composed of nodes (i.e. neurons), which make up an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are particularly adept at handling image classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The article Histopathological Cancer Detection with Deep Neural Networks [TowardsDataScience] discusses the use of deep neural networks for histopathological cancer detection. It explains how these advanced algorithms can analyze tissue samples to identify cancer cells with high accuracy. This article highlights the potential of deep neural networks in improving cancer diagnosis and treatment through automated precise detection methods.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The article The detection of cancer cells in histopathology based on machine vision [ScienceDirect-1], published July 20222 in Computers in Biology and Medicine, discusses why breast cancer detection is so important and how machine vision is able to improve traditional breast cancer detection. Breast cancer is an incredibly pressing issue facing the modern world. It is estimated that ⅛ women will develop breast cancer at some point, and by some metrics, it has overtaken lung leading cause of death out of all cancers worldwide. Furthermore, discovery in its early stages causes the possibility of a successful cure to rise to 80%. Traditional cancer detection through histopathological images is time consuming, difficult, hard to perform on large sets of data, and introduces a large amount of inconsistency from pathologist to pathologist. That’s why we are turning to machine image classification as it has the potential to be more accurate, more consistent, and much more efficient than individual pathologists could ever be.\n",
    "\n",
    "The article Current applications and challenges of artificial intelligence in pathology [ScienceDirect-2] explores the role of AI and ML in computational pathology. It discusses how AI algorithms can analyze medical images such as histopathology slides to assist in diagnosing diseases. The article emphasizes the potential of AI in improving accuracy, efficiency, and personalized medicine in pathology, while acknowledging the challenges and ethical considerations associated with its implementation. \n",
