    "\n",
    "Our goal for this project is to develop a deep learning / computer vision model to identify breast cancer based on pathology images from the PatchCamelyon (PCam) dataset, using binary classification. The PatchCamelyon dataset consists of 327,680 color images of lymph node samples, each with a size of 96x96 pixels. The images are labeled with one of two classes either indicating the presence or absence of metastatic tissue (which indicates cancerous tissue). We will first pre-process the data by binarizing the pixels to reduce noise. Then, we will be training the last layer of a convolutional neural network on this data. The neural network will be trained to classify the images to a binary label (the detection of cancerous tissue). Success will be measured using sensitivity and specificity. Our main goal is to reduce the false negative rate (by maximizing sensitivity), since false negatives are far more fatal than false positives in this scenario."

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The article Artificial intelligence and computational pathology [Nature], published in 2021 by researchers Miao Cui and David Y. Zhang, discusses the immense potential that artificial intelligence has in the field of clinical pathology. Computational pathology uses technology to improve patient care in pathology and lab medicine. It combines different types of medical data, like images and patient information, to make better diagnoses and treatment plans. However, there are many challenges to overcome, like integrating the data and making sure the technology is used ethically. By utilizing modern computational methods, such as genomics, bioinformatics, and machine learning, and applying them to pathology, computational pathology has the potential to “create personalized diagnosis and treatment plans for patients,” “improve clinical workflow efficiency, diagnostic quality,” and offer a “better-integrated solution to whole-slide images, multi-omics data, and clinical informatics.” Most importantly, computational pathology can “reduce errors in diagnosis and classification.” The article states that machine learning algorithms evaluated by CAMELYON16, which evaluates how well algorithms can detect cancer, “[have] achieved encouraging results with a 92.4% sensitivity in tumor detection rate. In contrast, a pathology could only achieve 73.2% sensitivity.” Artificial intelligence is useful for the task of detecting cancer in pathology slide images because it can be trained to find patterns in data and is able to autonomously learn to solve novel problems. Currently, machine learning methods are being used to assist pathologic diagnosis by looking at cancer cells, cell nuclei, cell divisions, ducts, blood vessels, and more. Deep learning and artificial neural networks (ANNs) resemble human cognition, being composed of nodes (i.e. neurons), which make up an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are particularly adept at handling image classification tasks.\n",

    "The article Histopathological Cancer Detection with Deep Neural Networks [TowardsDataScience] discusses the use of deep neural networks for histopathological cancer detection. It explains how these advanced algorithms can analyze tissue samples to identify cancer cells with high accuracy. This article highlights the potential of deep neural networks in improving cancer diagnosis and treatment through automated precise detection methods.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The article The detection of cancer cells in histopathology based on machine vision [ScienceDirect-1], published July 20222 in Computers in Biology and Medicine, discusses why breast cancer detection is so important and how machine vision is able to improve traditional breast cancer detection. Breast cancer is an incredibly pressing issue facing the modern world. It is estimated that ⅛ women will develop breast cancer at some point, and by some metrics, it has overtaken lung leading cause of death out of all cancers worldwide. Furthermore, discovery in its early stages causes the possibility of a successful cure to rise to 80%. Traditional cancer detection through histopathological images is time consuming, difficult, hard to perform on large sets of data, and introduces a large amount of inconsistency from pathologist to pathologist. That’s why we are turning to machine image classification as it has the potential to be more accurate, more consistent, and much more efficient than individual pathologists could ever be.\n",

    "The article Current applications and challenges of artificial intelligence in pathology [ScienceDirect-2] explores the role of AI and ML in computational pathology. It discusses how AI algorithms can analyze medical images such as histopathology slides to assist in diagnosing diseases. The article emphasizes the potential of AI in improving accuracy, efficiency, and personalized medicine in pathology, while acknowledging the challenges and ethical considerations associated with its implementation. \n",

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Our solution to this problem will be to train a convolutional neural network on the breast cancer image dataset to determine whether a tumor exists in the given image or not. Convolutional neural networks are typically applied to image classification tasks as they are able to learn features from the training images in service of the given task (binary classification). This means we won’t have to manually derive what pixels or groups of pixels in the image are indicative of a positive and negative class, the model will learn through gradient descent. We plan on building our own CNN model using PyTorch / PyTorch Lightning as well as loading a pre-trained ResNet50 model and retraining the last layer to map to our labels. We also plan on using a Naive Bayes model that just predicts the most popular class every time as our benchmark model. Our solution will be tested by splitting our dataset into a training, validation, and test set. The training and validation set will be used during model training with the test set being used to report final evaluation metrics. "

    "# Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "An evaluation metric we plan on using is the ROC-AUC. This metric will be useful for measuring performance across different thresholds. Breast cancer diagnosis is not something to be taken lightly so we want to make sure we’re choosing a classification threshold that balances true positive rate and false positive rate appropriately. It will also allow us to directly compare against different models using a single scalar value. We also want to take into account the F-score and accuracy of our models to take into account all aspects of true and false diagnosis."

    "# Preliminary results\n",
    "In our analysis, we utilized popular deep learning models including ResNet50, VGG19, and DenseNet to evaluate their suitability in predicting our specific problem. The performance of these models was assessed by measuring their accuracy, which ranged from approximately 60 to 80 percent. Our objective is to enhance this accuracy further and achieve better predictive results.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the analysis, we experimented with different learning rates, which varied from 0.0001 to 0.1. This exploration aimed to find the optimal learning rate that can improve the model's performance. Additionally, we observed that the batch size, which determines the number of samples processed together in each iteration, exhibited significant variability. This variability allowed us to explore the effects of different batch sizes on the model's learning and convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the number of epochs, representing the number of complete passes of the entire dataset during training, was set to a maximum of 10 in our analysis. This choice was based on considerations such as computational resources and the convergence behavior of the models. By monitoring the performance of the models on a validation dataset, we aimed to determine the optimal number of epochs to prevent overfitting and maximize predictive performance.\n",
    " \n",
    "To present a comprehensive overview of the models' performance, we have included a table that summarizes the accuracy and other relevant metrics for each of the evaluated models. This table provides a comparative analysis of the different models, aiding in the understanding of their relative strengths and weaknesses. Through this rigorous analysis and exploration of various parameters, we aim to improve the accuracy of our predictive models and enhance their overall performance for the given problem. ResNet50, while a powerful deep learning model, is known to face challenges when dealing with small images due to its high number of convolutions. Recognizing this limitation, we decided to explore alternative models that could better handle small images. In our investigation, we turned to VGG and DenseNet, both of which have fewer convolutions compared to ResNet50 and have demonstrated improved performance when it comes to handling smaller images. These models offer a more suitable architecture for our specific problem, allowing us to extract meaningful features and achieve better results with the smaller image inputs. By leveraging VGG and DenseNet, we aim to overcome the limitations posed by ResNet50 and enhance our ability to effectively analyze and predict outcomes with small images.\n",

    "There are a few ethical concerns that always arise using machine learning models. Firstly, the concern of explainability. Since a general practice in medicine is that one must always have full autonomy over their own data, using a machine learning model on that data to check if they have cancer or not can be a huge decision. Because of this, it’s considered good practice to make models explainable, so that users can use informed consent to opt-in or opt-out of certain algorithms being run on their data. Without understanding the ways that machine learning models work, people may not be able to give full informed consent to use their data, which brings up ethical concerns of the deployment of this model into the healthcare industry. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another common concern in reinforcement learning models (that this may be in deployment) is that of split consent. One may consent to use their data as an algorithm subject (such that their data is run through the model to get a response), but not as a data subject (such that their data is used to retrain the model). Especially in a field like medicine where biological records are considered PII data, having full control over such data is important. Further, with data consent laws in the state of California requiring the ability to revoke access to any of your data, it’s a question of how this model may be trained such that data is used in a manner that includes informed consent."
